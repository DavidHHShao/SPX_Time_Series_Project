This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
Data <- read.csv("spx.csv", header=FALSE, sep=",")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
str(Data)
head(Data)
tail(Data)
which(is.na(Data$V1))
which(is.na(Data$V2))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
